 People’s Republic of China Sakura’s Disable List (Reconstruction for 2026, WIP)

## My sincerest gratitudes to:

- **ShadowShift**, he made the bundle lists in the 1st place (without them, DL builds would not be possible.) 
- **Dee Pink**, he gave me a tip on how to hit harder on DL (especially with Premium) and optimized my `$wa` DL once. 
- **SleepyRanger**, he gave me the right command for zeroing in series from bundles that are deemed undesirable to hit on. 
- **Anonymous** (preferred not to be mentioned) and an unknown player who made the original `$wg` DL’s.
- **An unknown** player made the original `$ha` DL.
- My friends who gave me encouragement to keep me going.
- Original builds (some) credit to sedmelluq. https://gist.github.com/sedmelluq/6944fa5d8100e44c34cb31c93ec113a9

Note: Those are optimal DL builds (disable the highest count of target roulette’s characters based on how many slots), they might contain the series you want to roll and might not contain the disliked series (the DL can be modified for your taste thanks ). Alternatively, wish the characters or anti-disable the desired series to circumvent the DL’s (except $toggle and $sdl). I do need to update the lists once per character update.

If you have any matters/questions on DL builds, contact me on Discord by user ID: 405717573230133248

DL Guide for 2026 (Need update, TBA)

# Terminology

* `$tw` - `$togglewestern`, personal toggle (assumed always used thus series from `Western` disabled)
* `$ti` - `$toggleirl`, personal toggle (assumed always used thus series from `Real Life People` disabled)
* `$th` - `$togglehentai`, server toggle (can do `$settings` to check if used)
* `$td` - `$togglehorror`, server toggle (can do `$settings` to check if used)
